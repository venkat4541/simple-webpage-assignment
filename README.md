### This is an assignment given out by a company in recruitment process. Below was the description of the task:

> -
####We would like for you create a simple web page that includes the following:

> * A centered logo
> * Three nav items with hover and visited states
> * Form field that returns result "hello" when number less than 10 is entered
> * Main image with text that appears over image on rollover
> * Three blocks with image and small block of text underneath and text that appears over image on rollover

> There is a wireframe attached. Images and graphics (like the logo or any icon can be swipe and will not be evaluated as part of the project). Text can all be lorem ipsum. 

> We are looking for properly formatted code. Images should resize when screen is adjusted. **Most importantly, please don't spend time on design or worry at all about making this pretty. If the actual wireframe attached is submitted in a working format with good code, that is all we are looking to see.** 

> Submit as a zipped project folder.
